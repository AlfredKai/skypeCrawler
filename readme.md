# Skype Crawler

Browser extension to crawl Skype web interface and extract history of conversations since Skype doesn't provide APIs to do so.

## Usage

Before becomming a browser extension, this was a simple script that you could run in your browser console. It's still possible to do so, but you'll have to manually copy/paste the code in the console. Simply open the file `content.js` and copy/paste the content in your browser console. The script will then start crawling the Skype web interface and extract the history of conversations. Execute `stopTask()` in the console to stop crawling and download the messages.
